# HPC - Knapsack #
TODO: description...

This is the result of the project of the course 'High Performance Computing' in the semester SS2015 at the University of Applied Sciences Kaiserslautern. The aim of the project was to solve the knapsack problem and parallelize the algorithm. The project was done by 

* Kevin Ke√üler (keke0002@stud.hs-kl.de) and
* Viktor Maier (vima0001@stud.hs-kl.de).

## The Knapsack Problem ##
You have a knapsack with a limited capacity and a list of items you can put into the knapsack. All items have the properties weight and worth/profit. The problem is that you have to pack the knapsack so that the sum of the items weight does not exceed the capacity of the knapsack and the profit is maximized. The problem is in the set of NP-complete problems. This means effort to solve such a problem increases exponentially with the input size, in our case list of items (and capacity of the knapsack).
