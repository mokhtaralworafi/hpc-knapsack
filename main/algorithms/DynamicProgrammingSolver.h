/**
 * The DynamicProgrammingSolver extends the KnapSackSolver class and
 * implements the abstract method solve().
 *
 * Solves the KnapSack-Problem with the dynamic programming approach.
 * The main knapsack-problem is being solved in a bottom-up manner by solving
 * all sub-problems first. When the optimal worths of the base problems
 * are known, the worths of higher sub problems are calculated until
 * the worth of main problem is known. Afterwards the items belonging to the
 * calculated worth are added to the solutionlist.
 *
 * This version is only compatible to integer input values and can not handle floating point values.
 * To handle floating point values, we could multiply them (e.g. by 100) and parse them them to integer
 * but this delivers only a low accuracy and makes the problem / matrix to solve more complex.
 * To solve problems with floating point values we have implemented the algorithm of Nemhauser and Ullmann
