 * The DynamicProgrammingParallelSolver extends the KnapSackSolver class and
 * implements the abstract method solve().
 *
 * It follows the same approach as the DynamicProgramminParallelSolver
 * (see DynamicProgrammingSolver.h)
 * but calculates the entries of each row in parallel.
 *
 * This version is only compatible to integer input values and can not handle floating point values.
 * To handle floating point values, we could multiply them (e.g. by 100) and parse them them to integer
 * but this delivers only a low accuracy and makes the problem / matrix to solve more complex.
