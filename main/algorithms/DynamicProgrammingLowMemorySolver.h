/**
 * The DynamicProgrammingLowMemorySolver extends the KnapSackSolver class and
 * implements the abstract method solve().
 *
 * Solves the KnapSack-Problem with the dynamic programming approach (see DynamicProgrammingSolver).
 * But instead of storing the whole matrix / result table, this algorithm reduces the used storage
 * by only storing the currently needed data within two rows (instead of numOfItem rows). Instead of
 * having the whole table we just need one row which stores the previously calculated worths and uses
 * them to calculate the worths of the next iteration.
 * This however causes some difficulty when trying to backtrack the items of the solution.
 * We could simply
 * TODO: explain backtracking. siehe seite 66 in kellerer buch
 *
 * This version is only compatible to integer input values and can not handle floating point values.
 * To handle floating point values, we could multiply them (e.g. by 100) and parse them them to integer
 * but this delivers only a low accuracy and makes the problem / matrix to solve more complex.
 * To solve problems with floating point values we have implemented the algorithm of Nemhauser and Ullmann
